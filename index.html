            <p>
                The U.S. presidential election process is a core part of the american democracy, 
                occuring every four years. It is how the country decides on 
                <strong style="color:#ff0000;">their next President</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em style="color:#3333cc;">Candidates</em> from all kinds of political parties campaign 
                across the U.S., talking to voters and explaining their plans. Eventually, people vote 
                on Election Day, and the Electoral College does the final determination (we’ll see next).

            <h2>Electoral College</h2>
            <p>
                The Electoral College is a <strong style="color: #ff6600;">unique system</strong> used by the U.S. 
                Instead of relying solely on the popular vote, each state is assigned a number of electors 
                based on its representation in Congress.
            </p>
            <!-- 
               Blockquote for a snippet from the US Constitution 
               (some folks might not realize how old these rules are).
            -->
            <blockquote>
                “The Electors shall meet in their respective States, and vote by Ballot for President and Vice-President...” 
                — <em>U.S. Constitution, Article II, Section 1</em>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                A candidate typically needs 270 electoral votes to win. States mostly give 
                <em>all</em> their votes to the top candidate for that state, but Maine and Nebraska do it differently.

            <h2>Voting Process</h2>
            <p>
                Every citizen who wishes to vote must be properly registred, which is governed by each state’s rules. 
                On <strong>Election Day</strong>, Americans cast their ballots in person, by mail, or even early in some states.
            </p>
            <p>
                The popular vote in most states is "winner-take-all," awarding the entire set of electoral votes 
                to the candidate who leads in that state’s popular count.
